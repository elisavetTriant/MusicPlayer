# Music Player App

## Musical Structure App

The Musical Structure App was made as an assignment to practice creating User Interfaces for Android and Multi-Screen Apps at Udacity's Android Basics by Google Nanodegree Program 2018

The goal was to design and layout the flow for the structure of a Music Player app using Intents, New Activities, Arraylists, Loops and Custom Classes.

Note that for this project, the app did not not actually need to play music and dummy data where added to the App.

Project reviewed and passed on 16-Apr-18 with tree https://github.com/elisavetTriant/MusicPlayer/tree/5c68e174c6c668845fb77e1d3f01912f3cd4bee2, or commit https://github.com/elisavetTriant/MusicPlayer/commit/5c68e174c6c668845fb77e1d3f01912f3cd4bee2 of the master branch.

## Single Screen Music Player App

Also Created a small but fully-functional App, that lives in its own branch the OneScreenMusicPlayer.

The App is simple, it loads your audio files from your device's storage, after your permission, and display's them in a list. Uppon tapping on the list item, your audio player loads and play's the selected audio.
